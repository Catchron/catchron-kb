## Legacy Grub

1. Grand Unified Boot Loader (GRUB) on a Master Boot Reckord (MBR)<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xoV1HK5.gif" width="500"/><br>
   1. Boot the computer
   2. The BIOS checks out
   3. Stage 1 - The BIOS will locate the Master Boot Reckord
      - GRUB has a small image file ``boot.img`` that exists withing the MBR. The MBR is within the first 512 bytes of your HDD.
   4. Stage 1.5 - The ``boot.img`` file is actually looking to load the ``core.img``.
      - The purpose of ``core.img`` is to locate the boot partition of the system.
   5. Stage 2 - This is where the actual boot partiton gets read within the ``/boot/grub`` directory. Legacy GRUB is looking for one of the two files:
      - ``grub.conf`` or ``menu.lst``
      - ``device.map``
   6. The Linux Kernel is loaded<br>


2. Example Legacy grub.conf<br>

   1. This is where the boot disk is located
   2. Which Kernel Title is going to be booted by default
   3. How many seconds the user has the option to interrupt the GRUB Boot Loader
   4. Background Image for GRUB
   5. The Title Line refers to the actual Kerenl we are going to use. It contains the kernel version and the location on the hdd which the kernel is going to consider root.
   6. The kernel line with additional boot options
   7. The initial RAM disk for the kernel
   8. A second Title Line with a second Kernel.

3. Installing GRUB
   - GRUB considers ``/boot`` its root directory

> ``grub-install <device>`` - This command install GRUB to the specified device. The device can be ``/dev/sda`` or ``/dev/hd0``
    - Executing grub-install on an active system is bad. This step is typically done from a live CD/USB where GRUB is getting installed to a new disk

## GRUB2

1. Differences between the Master Boot Reckord (MBR) and GUID Partition Tables (GPT)
   - MBR:
     - Traditionally supported only 26 partitions.
     - Partition size limited to 2TB
   - GPT:
     - Supports 128 paritions
     - Partition size up in the ZB range
     - Needs a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) to boot.
       - Replacement for traditional BIOS, can act in legacy BIOS mode
       - Requries a 64bit OS
       - Prevents unauthorised OS from booting on the system
2. GRUB2 on GPT with UEFI
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Nm9wTQA.gif" width="500"/><br>
   1. Boot the computer
   2. The UEFI/BIOS checks out
   3. Stage 1 - The UEFI will locate the Master Boot Reckord
	    - GRUB has a small image file ``boot.img`` that exists withing the MBR. The MBR is within the first 512 bytes of your HDD.
   4. After the MBR you have GPT Header. This is to let the system know this is a GPT Style disk
   5. After GPT Header you have a Partition Entry Array. A list of all the partitions, where they are located and their IDs.
   6. Stage 1.5 - The ``boot.img`` file is actually looking to load the ``core.img``.
	    - The purpose of ``core.img`` is to locate the boot partition of the system.
   7. The ``core.img`` is looking for a ``/boot/efi`` partition. This is also known as the efi System Partition (ESP). This needs to be ``vfat`` or ``FAT32`` only.
   8. Stage 2 - Gets handed over to ``/boot/grub2``. The two main files ``grubenv`` and ``themes``

3. GRUB2 Config Commands:

> ``grub2-editenv list`` - View the default boot entry for the grub config file.

> ``grub2-mkconfig`` - Creates (or updates) a ``/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`` file based on entries from the ``/etc/default/grub`` file.
(On Debian systems, the ``2`` is ommited from the commands name - ``grub-mkconfig``)

> ``update-grub`` - Command that can be usd to update a GRUB2 config after chagens to /etc/default/grub have been made. Found on Debian systems.
