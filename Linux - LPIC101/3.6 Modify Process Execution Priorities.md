## Understanding and Changing Process Priorities

Process Priorities
- All processes need to use CPU time
- Priority assignment dictates how much time the CPU grants the process
- Process priority have a numerical value called **nice level**.
  - **-20** (highest priority)
  - **19** (lowest priority)
  - **0** (default for most processes)

- Only root can lower the **nice level** value of a process

> ``nice`` - Command used to define a new nice level before an application is started.

> ``renice`` - Command used to change the nice level of an application that is already running.
