## Legacy MBR (Master Boot Record) Partitions

### MBR Partitioning Tools

> ``lsblk`` - Command used to list out block devices (such as HDDs)

> ``fdisk`` - Leegacy command used to create partitions ofr MBR or GPT types

> ``parted`` Modern command used to create partitions of MBR and GPT types

Partition IDs:
83 - stadanrd Linux filesystems
82 - Linux swap partiitons
8e - Linux LVM Volumes

## GPT (GUID Partition Table) Partitions

### GPT Partitionin Tools

> ``gdisk`` - This is a command in the style of ``fdisk`` that can be used to create GPT partitions.

> ``parted`` - This command can be used to create both MBR and GPT partitions

## SWAP Partitions

> ``fdisk``,``gdisk``,``parted`` - Any of these tools can be used to create swap partitions

> ``mkswap`` - This command is used to format a partition to be used as swap space

> ``swapon`` - Enables a swap parititon or file

> ``swapoff`` - Disables a swap partition or file

## Creating Linux Filesystems

### Linux File Systems

1. Non-Journaling
   - **ext2** - legacy fs, released in 1993

2. Journaling
   - Uses a journal to keep track of changes that have not yet been wrtten to the filesystem
   - **ext3** - released in 2001, introduced journaling to ext2
   - **ext4** - released in 2006, added extra freatures, meant to be a "stop-gap" until a better solution comes
   - **XFS** - created in 1993 for IRIX OS. Ported to Linux in 2001

### BTRFS

1. Uses CoW (Copy on Write)
2. Uses subvolumes
   - Similar to partition
   - Can be accessed like a directory
3. Snapshots
   - Subvolumes that reference the original data's location, includes metadata and directory structure

### FAT File Systems

1. FAT = File Allocation Table
   - Linux can use VFAT (virtual file allocation table) which allows for long file names
   - EFI Boot partitions need to use a FAT partition (on Linux this will be a vfat partition)

2. exFAT - Extended FAT file system
   - allows for file larger than 2 GB in size
   - primarily used for external disk drives and thumb drives

> ``mkfs`` - Create a new filessytem on a partiton.
>> ``mkfs -t [fs-type]``<br>
> ``mkfs.[fstype]``<br>
> **Example:**<br>
> ``mkfs.ext4 -L [LABEL-NAME]``

> ``blkid`` - Displays the filesystem's UUID
