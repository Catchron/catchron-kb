## File System Hierarchy Standard

### The role of a Linux Filesystem

Computer data is stored on a storage device with a certain manner:
- The data is organized and easily located
- The data can be saved in a peristent manner
- Data integrity is preserved
- The data can be quickly retrieved for a user in a later point in time

### Standard Layout of the Linux File System

FS Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
- https://www.pathname.com/fhs/
- Directory Structure
  - invereted tree with a single root
  - Case sensitive
  - Paths are delimited by a ``/``
  - Any folder or file whose name is preceeded by a ``.`` are hidden from normal view
  - A single ``.`` in a directory refers to the current directory
  - A double ``..`` refers to the parent directory of any particular directory, one direcotry up in the file hierarchy

``/`` - The root of our filesystem.<br>
``bin`` - Executable programs that the users on the system can run. This is where the ``ls``, ``cd``, ``pwd``, ``echo`` and other commands would reside <br>
``boot`` - Contains the files needed to get the computer booted up. The Linux Kernel itself also resides in this directory.<br>
``dev`` - Where all devices are referenced from. This includes HDDs, keyboards, soundcards, and anything else that connects to the computer<br>
``etc`` - Contains configuration files for most of the system services and system info <br>
``home`` - Contains all the user files<br>
``lib`` & ``lib64`` - For library files that conain code that is shared with many applications on our system<br>
``media`` - It is where CD Drives are mounted along with USB Drives and others. <br>
``mnt`` - It is where you can access other HDDs mounted on your system <br>
``opt`` - Optional location for applications not stored in the ``/bin`` directory<br>
``proc`` - Info about the running Linux system <br>
``root`` - The home directory for the ``root`` user. <br>
``sbin`` - Where system admin tools and programs are located <br>
``srv`` - Typically used for server applications <br>
``sys`` - Contains info of the hardware on the system <br>
``tmp`` - Usualyl used by applications to store temporary data.<br>
``usr`` - This is the user directory. It contains its own set of directory tree that<br> mirrors that of the root directory. You can find more applications here along with system documentation and other configuration files <br>
``var`` - Contains files that tend to vary in size such as log files <br>

## Finding Commands on a Linux System

### Finding Commands

> ``locate`` - Command that searches a local database of files and folders looking for items that match the searched criteria

> ``updatedb`` - Updates the database that the ``locate`` command uses

> ``whereis`` - This command locates binary, source and/or manual pages for a command
