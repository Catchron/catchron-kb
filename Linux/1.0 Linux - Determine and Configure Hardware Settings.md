## Pseudo File Systems

1. A regular file system is a method of laying out files and folders on a physical hard disk

2. A pseudo file system does not exist on a physical hard disk:
   * Only exists in RAM while system is running
   * The two primary pesudo file system locations in Linux are:
     * ``/proc`` - Contains inforamtion about the processes runnin on a system. Processes are listed by PID, with hardware and process data both in the same directory strcuture
     * ``/sys`` - Contains information about the system's hardware and kernel modules. No process information is listed here

> ``man proc`` - Shows local documentation on the /proc pseudo file system
