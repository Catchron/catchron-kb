## Pseudo File Systems

1. A regular file system is a method of laying out files and folders on a physical hard disk

2. A pseudo file system does not exist on a physical hard disk:
   * Only exists in RAM while system is running
   * The two primary pesudo file system locations in Linux are:
     * ``/proc`` - Contains inforamtion about the processes runnin on a system. Processes are listed by PID, with hardware and process data both in the same directory strcuture
     * ``/sys`` - Contains information about the system's hardware and kernel modules. No process information is listed here

> ``man proc`` - Shows local documentation on the /proc pseudo file system

## Linux Kernel in Brief

1. The core framework of the OS
   - GNU/Linux
	   - GNU - This relates to all the tools such as the **bash** commands, the different types of shells and other utulitities that you can use
		 - Linux - This reelates to the Linux kernel
2. Provides a way for the rest of the system to operate with hardwarem, memory, networking and itself
3. Linux kernel is monolithic
   - The kernel handls all memory management and hardware devices interactions
	 - Extra functuionality can be loaded and unloaded dynamicall through kernel modules
	 - Ensures that the system will not need to be rebooted into a different kernel image for added functionality
	   - What this basically means is that when you need to add a new driver you do not have to reboot the whole system
4. Many third-party Linux kernel modules are device drivers

> ``uname`` - Displays info about the currently running kernel
> ``lsmod`` - Displays a listing of all currently loaded kernel modules
> ``modinfo`` - Displays info about a specific kernel module
> ``modprobe`` - Command used to dynamically load and unload kernel modules at runtime
