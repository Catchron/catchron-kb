## Linux Boot Sequence
<br>

1. Boot Logs
   - Usually these logs will be wiped when the computer is restarted

> ``dmesg`` - The traditional utility used for viewing the kernel ring buffer

- Kernel Ring Buffer -

> ``journalctl -k`` - Systemd utility to view the kernel ring buffer withing the systemd journal

- systemd -

## init

1. init - short for initialization
2. Based off of the System V init used in UNIX systems
3. sysvinit - Written by Miquelvan Smoorenburg
4. Service are started one after the other, in a serial fashion
5. init startup:
   1. Linux kernel loads up
   2. It seeks initialization system to hand over control in ``/sbin/init``
   3. Init program is now in control and it looks for configuration settings in ``/etc/inittab``<br>

6. The init process reads the ``inittab`` file to determine what runlevel the system should be operating in.
- The runlevel is pre-defined configuration that the computer will oeprate withing<br>

7. innitab:
   - <identifier>:<runlevel>:<action>:<process><br>
![](https://i.imgur.com/5CK7olH.gif)
   - Each line specifies a runlevel
   - ``wait`` - The process specified will be started once when the runlevel in entered, and ``init`` will wait for its termination
   - Example of how a system traditionally starts:

8. Scripts that init is using to get the system running:
   - Red Hat: ``/etc/rc.d/``<br>
![](https://i.imgur.com/2jPMnje.gif)
	   - ``rc`` stands for **run commands**
     - The ``rc`` directories are related to the different run levels
		 - the ``rc.sysinit`` does housecleaning before it passes the system to ``init``
		 - ``rc.local`` - this file is customized by the admin to add additional startup scripts
		 - if we navigate to one of the directory containing the startup scripts for that particular run level we will see a list of scripts.
       - the letter ``K`` defines the services that need to be Killed
       - the letter ``S`` defines the services that need to be Started
       - the number defines the order in which the scripts need to be executed
     - ``init.d`` contains the scripts needed for the runlevels
     - ``/etc/init.d/rc`` - script that orchestrates how the runlevel scripts run and what occurs when a runlevel changes
   - Debian: ``/etc/init.d/``

## upstart

1. First used in Ubuntu 6
2. Eventually used in RHEL 6, Debian and Fedora 9
3. Unlike init, upstart offers asychronous starting of services - decreasing boot up times
4. Works off of real-time events, which init was not designed to understand
   - Upstart not only stops and starts services but monitors their avaliblity
5. init vs upstart - Boot Sequence<br>

   - ``init`` is static. It does not natively respond to changes in the system
   - ``upstart`` is dynamic. It can respond to changes on the system
   - A change on a Linux systems is an event  
   - Events trigger jobs
   - Jobs have two categories
     - Tasks
     - Services
   - The ``upstart daemon`` uses job states

## systemd

1. init and part of upstart rely on Bash shell Scripts
2. Systemd replces the functionality of the shell scripts with compiled C code
3. Still compatible with older System V Init scripts
4. Unit File Locations
   - Provided by package installations (Do not edit these unit files!):
     - ``/usr/lib/systemd/system``
   - Unif file location for system admins (These take precedence over those in /usr)
     - ``/etc/systemd/system``
   - Runtime unit files
     - ``/run/systemd/system``
   - View all unit files on a system
> ``systemctl list-unit-files``

5. Components of the Unit file
   - Unit files follow the INI style format first seen in MS-DOS
     - [Unit]
     - Description=Multi-User System
     - Dcoumentation=man:systemd.special(7)
     - Requires=basic.target
       - or Wants=(more robust)
     - Conflicts=rescue.service rescue.target
     - After=basic.target resuce.service rescue.target
> ``man 5 system.unit``

> ``systemctl cat <something>.<unit>``<br>
This will print out the contents of the unit file specified
Example:<br>

6. How does systemd boot the system?
   - The kernel still looks for ``/sbing/init``
   - ``systemd`` just took the place of ``/sbin/init``
