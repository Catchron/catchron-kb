> ``runlevel`` - view your current runlevel<br>
``N`` stands for "No pervious runlevel"

> ``telinit`` - change to another level

2. Chaging runlevels at Boot
   1. Interrupt the GRUB boot process by pressing any key during startup
   2. In the GRUB menu slect a kernel to modify
   3. Press the ``a`` key to add arguments to the end of the kernel line
   4. Enter in a runlevel number
   - You can check the defult init level in ``/etc/inittab``

## Change your Working Einviornment: Targets

1. The **Target Unit** files dictate the type of environment that you would work in
2. A **Target Unit** is a unit file that syncs up other units when the computer boots or changes states
3. The most common use for a target is to get the system into a new state
   - i.e., a state with just a command line: multi-user.target
   - i.e., a state with a desktop environment: graphical.target

4. When you are running a target unit, other units (services, slices) associate themselves with the target to define the operating environment

5. Types of targets
   - multi-user.target
   - graphical.target
   - rescue.target
   - basic.target
   - sysinit.target

> ``systemctl cat <something>.target`` - Het info about a specific target unit file<br>
Example:<br>

> ``systemctl list-unit-files -t target`` - Show all unit files for avalible targets<br>
Example:<br>

> ``systemctl list-units -t targets`` - Show all loaded and active unit files

> ``systemctl get-default`` - List out the default target

> ``systemctl set-default <state>.target`` - Change the default target <br>
Example:<br>

> ``systemctl <state>`` - To change to a different target<br>
Example:<br>
``systemctl rescue``
``systemctl default``

> ``systemctl reboot`` - Will runn the ``reboot.target``. Same thing as ``reboot``

> ``systemctl poweroff`` - Will perform a compelte shutdown. Will isolate the system to ``poweroff.target``. Same thing as ``poweroff``

## Reboot and Shutd Down your system

1. Reboot Commands

> ``reboot``

> ``telinit 6``

> ``shutdown -r now``

> ``systemctl isolate reboot.target``

2. The ``wall`` command will set a message for your users.

> ``wall`` - Broadcasts a message to all logged users. After message is typed, terminate the message with ``Ctrl+D``

3. Shutdown commands

> ``poweroff``

> ``telinit 0``

> ``shutdown -h +1`` - This will shut down your system in 1 minute. To cancel shutdown press ``Ctrl+D``

> ``systemctl isolate poweroff.target``

4. Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (acpid)
   - it registers power events - such as pressing the power button or closing the laptop lid
   - the config files are located in ``/etc/acpi``
