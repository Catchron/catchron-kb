## Linux Boot Sequence

1. Boot Logs
   - Usually these logs will be wiped when the computer is restarted

> ``dmesg`` - The traditional utility used for viewing the kernel ring buffer

- Kernel Ring Buffer -

> ``journalctl -k`` - Systemd utility to view the kernel ring buffer withing the systemd journal

- systemd -

## init

1. init - short for initialization
2. Based off of the System V init used in UNIX systems
3. sysvinit - Written by Miquelvan Smoorenburg
4. Service are started one after the other, in a serial fashion
5. init startup:
   1. Linux kernel loads up
   2. It seeks initialization system to hand over control in ``/sbin/init``
   3. Init program is now in control and it looks for configuration settings in ``/etc/inittab``<br>

6. The init process reads the ``inittab`` file to determine what runlevel the system should be operating in.
- The runlevel is pre-defined configuration that the computer will oeprate withing<br>

7. innitab:
   - <identifier>:<runlevel>:<action>:<process><br>

   - Each line specifies a runlevel
   - ``wait`` - The process specified will be started once when the runlevel in entered, and ``init`` will wait for its termination
   - Example of how a system traditionally starts:

8. Scripts that init is using to get the system running:
   - Red Hat: ``/etc/rc.d/``
     - ![](https://i.imgur.com/2jPMnje.gif)
	   - ``rc`` stands for **run commands**
     - The ``rc`` directories are related to the different run levels
		 - the ``rc.sysinit`` does housecleaning before it passes the system to ``init``
		 - ``rc.local`` - this file is customized by the admin to add additional startup scripts
		 - if we navigate to one of the directory containing the startup scripts for that particular run level we will see a list of scripts.
       - the letter ``K`` defines the services that need to be Killed
       - the letter ``S`` defines the services that need to be Started
       - the number defines the order in which the scripts need to be executed
     - ``init.d`` contains the scripts needed for the runlevels
		 - ``/etc/init.d/rc`` - script that orchestrates how the runlevel scripts run and what occurs when a runlevel changes
   - Debian: ``/etc/init.d/``
