## Main File System locations

1. Primary locations to know:
   - ``/`` - Bottom of the directory
   - ``/var`` - The variable location. Log files and dynamic content (such as websites)
   - ``/home`` - The user's home directory
   - ``/boot`` - The boot directory is usually on its own partition. Here we have Linux kernel and supporting files
   - ``/opt`` - Location used for optional softare and often used by third-party software vendors. Enterprise environments make extensive use of this location

2. SWAP Space
   - SWAP is a temp storage that acts like RAM
   - When the RAM is full, the kernel will move less used data to SWAP
   - SWAP Partition is the most common setup  
   - SWAP file is similar to the page file on Windows
     - Much slower than using a dedicated partition
   - Sizing:
     - Rule ranges from 1.5x to 2.0x the size of your avalible RAM
     - Do not go less than 50% of your RAM

3. Partitions and Mount Points
   - ``/dev/sda``<br>

   - If you have a single HDD - that would be ``/dev/sda``
   - The ``/dev`` directory is the location where you can see all your attached hardware
   - ``sda`` is your first drive that the kernel recognized
     - ``/dev/sda1`` is the first partition of the ``sda`` drive
     - ``/dev/sda2`` is another partition
     - ``/dev/sda3`` is a third partition
     - Each partition can have a specific function
   - A ``Mount Point`` is taking a partition or disk and mounting it to a directory
     - In the diagram above we have ``/dev/sda1`` mounted to the root directory ``/``
     - The ``/dev/sda2`` is mounted to the ``/home`` directory. All user files will be stored there
     - The ``/dev/sda3`` is mounted to the boot directory

4. Useful commands:

> ``mount`` - Can be used to mount partitions to directories, or show all exisiting partitions<br>

> ``lsblk`` - Used to show all block devics on a system and their names<br>
Example:<br>

> ``fdisk -l /dev/diskname`` - Can be used to list out partion info on the specific disk<br>
Example:<br>

> ``swapon --summary`` - Shows a sumamry of the swap usage on the system, same info can be found in ``proc/swaps``

## LVM (Logical Volume Manager)

1. LVM allows the creation of groups of disks or partitions that can be assembled into a single (or multiple) filesystems:
   - Can be used for nearly any mount point except ``/boot``
   - It is flexible. Allows for resizing volumes
   - Allows Snapshots. It can have a point in time copy of your logical volume

2. Example Layoyut of an LVM Group<br>

   - At your bottom level you will have your physical volumes (``PV``) which are you actual disks that you have on your system such as ``/dav/sda``, ``/dev/sdb`` and ``/dev/sdc``
   - Above your physical volumes you will have your volume group (``VG``) named ``vg_base``. You can have one or multiple phyisical volumes that belong to your volume group
   - Above your volume group, you can have your logical volumes (``LV``) such as ``lv_root``, ``lv_var``, ``lv_swap``and ``lv_home``.
   - Above your logical volumes you will have your file system which we be ``zfs``, ``xfs``, etc. And we have the direcotires where the file systems will be mounted to.

3. Sampling of LVM Commands
> ``pvs`` - Lists out the physical volumens in an LVM group<br>
> ``bgs`` - Lists out the volume groups within an LVM group<br>
> ``lvs`` - Lists out the logical volumes within an LVM group<br>
