## Managing Shared Libraries

1. What is a Shared Library
   - Files that contain functionalities that other apps can use
   - WHen you have a new app, you do not have to design a common fucntionality like solving math problems. You just need to use the already exisitng library and focus on your custom code
   - These files end the ``file.so`` extension. ``*.so`` means shared object.
   - Those shared libraries can found in the following locations:
     - ``/lib``
     - ``/usr/lib`` or ``/usr/lib64``
     - ``/usr/local/lib``
     - ``usr/share``
   - There are two types of library files:
     - Dynamic - ends in ``*.so``
     - Statically linked - ends in ``*.a``

2. Managing Shared Libraries

> ``ldd`` - Points out shared object dependencies<br>

> ``ldconfig`` - Configures dynamic linker run-time binding, creates a cache based on lib directories and can show you what is currently cached

> ``/etc/ld.so.conf`` - Configuration file that points to directories and other configuration files that hold references to library.<br>

Here we can see the contents of the ld.so.conf file which leads us to a directory full of libraries.


> ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` - Legacy environment variable that points to a path where library files can be read from. Just add the directory of your custom app's library into the variable.
