## The Advanced Package Tool (apt)

1. APT is the default package tool for Debian systems
   - It is used to install applications and their dependencies
   - It can be used to remove and update packages

2. Basics of how APT works:
   - Reads the ``/etc/apt/sources.list``
     - This file contains the URLs for all software repositories that you can install software from
     - Once APT has installed the package and all of its dependencies required to install that package, it will direct all installation and uninstallation tasks for this pckages to the dpkg command

3. apt Commands

> ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` - Config file that lists our repository locations for packages<br>

1. This indicates the type of pacakge (in this case debian package)
2. This is the URL for the repo
3. Name of the distribution
4. Type of repository

> ``apt-get update`` - Updates the local apt cache with a listing of packages that can be updated/upgraded and installed

> ``apt-get upgrade`` - Upgrades the packages that have upgrades avalible

> ``apt-get install`` - Installs a package from the repositories in the ``sources.list`` file

> ``apt-get remove`` - Removes package from the system but any config files that came with the package will remain

> ``apt-get purge`` - Removes the pacakge from the system and any assoicated config files

> ``apt-get dist-upgrade`` - Upgrades all packages on the system up to the next release of the distro

> ``apt-get download`` - Downloads a package

> ``apt-cache search`` - Searches through your local apt cache for a package that can be installed

> ``apt-cache show`` - Lists out basic inforamtion about a package

> ``apt-cache showpkg`` - Displays more technical information about a pacakge

## Using the Debian Packagte (dpkg)

1. The Debian Package Utility
   - uses the ``*.deb`` package
   - The package contains
     - the applications itself
     - default config files that may come with the app
     - instructions on how and where to install the files
     - listing of all dependencies that the package requires

   - Dependencies need to aleredy be insttalled or installed with the package
     - ``apt`` handles dependcies for your - ``dpkg`` does not

2. dpkg Commands

> ``dpkg --info`` - Displays info on a package <br>
