## Bash Shell Environment

1. Linux Shells
   - The Shell is the command line environment that you work in on a Linux System
     - ``bash`` (bourne again shell) - the default shell
     - ``csh`` - C programming style syntax
     - ``ksh`` - KornShell, based on the Bourne shell, with some features of the C shell added
     - ``zsh`` - Z Shell includes elements of the Bash and Korn shell

2. Bash environment
   - Environment variables are part of the Bash Environment
     - They are settings that dictate common functionality and locations for various purposes
     - A Bash varialbe (including those that are environment variables) follow a certain format/syntax
     - Synatx:
       - ``VARIABLE=path,command,alias``
     - Example:
       - ``CWD=home/user/Documents``

   - We can also define Bash functions and we have some that are already defined
     - Users can create their own custom functions in Bash
     - Example:
       - ``function yo() {echo "yo"}``

> ``env`` - Command that displays environment varialbes

> ``echo`` - Versatile command that can be used to print the value of a variable to the screen

> ``set`` - Displays shell settings or shell variables for the session

> ``unset`` - Removes a variable or custom bash fuction

> ``shopt`` - Displays shell options and their current settings

> ``export`` - Command used to export a variable to the current shell and any new shells started from the current shell

> ``which`` - Used to locate the application file location <br>

> ``type`` - Used to determine if something is a function, file, alias, built-in, or keyword

Bash Quoting

> ``"weak" quotes`` - Weak quotes or double quotes will expand variables, but characters used for path substitution or for pattern matching will not be expanded

> ``'strong' quotes`` - Inside strong quotes nothing is interpreted


## Bash History and Manual Pages

1. Bash History

> ``history`` - Command that shows the most recently ran commands

> ``.bash_history`` - File located in the user's home directory that contains the previously run commands

> ``HISTFILESIZE`` - Environment variable that determines how many lines the ``.bash_history`` file will contain

2. Manual Pages

- Built-in manual pages for commands, config files, and system admin tasks
-  Invoked with: ``man [command name]``
-  Man Pages are broken into sections:
   1. Executable programs or shell commands
   2. System calls - functions provided by the kernel
   3. Library calls - functions within program libraries
   4. Special files - typically found in ``/dev``
   5. File formats and conventions - for example ``/etc/passwd`` and other config files
   6. Games
   7. Miscellaneous items and conventions - e.g. man(7), regex(7)
   8. System administrator commands - usually only for root
   9. Kernel routines (non standard)

> ``man`` - Command used to open the MAN page for a specified command

> ``man -k`` - Used to search the man pages for a specific key word

> ``apropos`` - Links to the ``man -k`` command

> ``man [section number]`` - Open a particular section number for a specified command
