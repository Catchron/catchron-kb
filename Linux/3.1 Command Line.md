2. Bash environment
   - Environment variables are part of the Bash Environment
     - They are settings that dictate common functionality and locations for various purposes
     - A Bash varialbe (including those that are environment variables) follow a certain format/syntax
     - Synatx:
       - ``VARIABLE=path,command,alias``
     - Example:
       - ``CWD=home/user/Documents``

   - We can also define Bash functions and we have some that are already defined
     - Users can create their own custom functions in Bash
     - Example:
       - ``function yo() {echo "yo"}``
