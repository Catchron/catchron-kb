## Redirecting Standard Output

- We can use special characters to intercept information before it gets to the STDOUT bucket.
- Those characters will redirect the processed information to another location - usually a file
- Those characters are:
  - ``>``
  - ``>>``<br>

## Standard Input - stdin

- Input into a process or application usually comes from entries made on the keyboard
- Standard Error has a file handle number associated with it: **0**
- Files and the standard output from commands can provide input to other commands
- We can use special characters for to redirect the standard output to standard input
- Those characters are:
  - ``<``
  - ``|``<br>
Example: <br>

> ``wc test.sh`` - Input comes from the keyboard

>``wc < test.sh`` - Input comes from the file

>``cat /etc/passwd | less`` - Input comes from stdout of cat cat command

## Standard Error - stderr

- Typically written to the screen
- Standard Error has a file handle number associated with it: **2**

## Redirecting

> ``internet-toaster.sh`` - STDERR goes to the screen

> ``internet-toaster.sh 2> error.log`` - STDERR gets redirected to a the error.log file

> ``internet-toaster.sh 2>&1 | less`` - STDERR and STDOUT gets sent as the STDIN of the **less** command
